## Research topic and goals
Monitoring the Arctic Climate (MAC) aims at refining estimates of the sea ice state over the last three decades and its impact on the atmosphere as a general purpose. Its specific purpose is to harvest the benefits of the latest high-resolution and high-quality satellite products available to generate a sea ice reanalysis at a resolution never explored up-to-date and examine the impacts of this sea ice reanalysis on numerical weather prediction (NWP) using a global atmospheric data assimilation system in RIKEN AICS.

MAC will generate the longest sea ice reanalysis and counting the largest number of ensemble members available up to date, at a ground-breaking resolution and exploiting the latest high quality and high resolution satellite products available. MAC will allow for the most robust estimate of the Arctic sea ice changes over the last decades and its uncertainty performed up to date and therefore deliver crucial information about Arctic changes monitoring, being hence a project of scientific excellence. MAC will also provide the most trustworthy sea ice initial conditions to train dynamical climate prediction systems and estimate future Arctic changes. The final results will be of utmost interest for local ecosystems and populations as well as for industries willing to invest in this region. Finally, MAC will assess to what extent NWP can benefit from using the high quality sea ice data for atmospheric analyses and forecasts, particularly for high-impact weather events with drastic human and economic consequences such as polar storms and even in mid latitudes. Therefore these results will be of key social significance.

### Contributions:
- to harvest the benefits of the highest quality highest resolution sea ice satellite products, through the use of the highest resolution explored up to date in sea ice reanalysis.
- to lead to a breakthrough in the monitoring and prediction of changes in the Arctic region, the most vulnerable to climate change.
- to trigger a collaboration on data assimilation between sea ice and atmosphere
