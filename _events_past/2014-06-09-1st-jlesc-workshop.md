The 11th workshop of the INRIA-Illinois-ANL Joint Laboratory on Petascale Computing will 
also be the first workshop of the NEXTGN Partnership University Fund project.

Il will gather top researchers in HPC from INRIA, the University of Illinois, 
the Argonne National Laboratory and Barcelona Supercomuting Center to explore research problems 
related to post Petascale Supercomputers and present early results of their joint work.

The workshop will present an exceptional program with papers accepted or submitted to top level conferences.

The workshop will expose the results of the collaboration on Parallel Programming, Resilience,I/O and Cloud.

Exascale issues, research and activities will be discussed as well.

A key objective of the workshop is to identify new research collaborations and establish a roadmap
for their implementation.

The workshop is open to Illinois, INRIA and ANL, faculties, researchers, engineers and students
who want to learn more about Post Petascale Computing.


## Workshop program

The workshop will feature technical sessions on five main topics:

* Big systems
* Parralel Programming (Hybrid, Hierarchical, Heterogeneous)
* Resilience
* Numerical Algorithms and Libraries
* I/O, Big data
* Cloud for HPC


## Workshop venue

The workshop will take place in the Inria Sophia Antipolis Méditerranée research centre.
The lodging for the workshop will be at Hotel Mercure and Hotel Ibis.
They are right next to each other and within reasonable walking distance to the conference venue.
