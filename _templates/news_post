Copy this file to `_posts/` and name it according to the naming convention of news posts as

Then fill in the YAML front matter variables:

  title            (required)
                   the title of the news post;
                   try to keep it short but descriptive

  date             (required)
                   the date the news post was written and published;
                   stick to the date format: YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS +ZZZZ

  updated          (optional)
                   in case the news post has received a significant update, put in the date of the
                   last update;
                   stick to the date format: YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS +ZZZZ

  author           (required)
                   the person ID of the author of the news post as defined in `_data/people.yml`
