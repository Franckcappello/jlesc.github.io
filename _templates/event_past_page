=== HOW TO USE THIS TEMPLATE ===
================================

Copy this file to `_events_past/` and name it according to the naming convention of event pages as
described in the JLESC website wiki: https://github.com/JLESC/jlesc.github.io/wiki/Conventions

Then fill in the YAML front matter variables:

  title            (required)
                   full title of the event

  date             (required)
                   the date this page was created in the format: YYYY-MM-DD;
                   this will get displayed at the very bottom of the generated website

  updated          (optional)
                   in case you or somebody else came back later and edited significant parts of the
                   page, put in the date (format: YYYY-MM-DD) of that change;
                   if present, this will get displayed at the very bottom of the generated website

  event_location   (optional)
                   where the event will take place;
                   try not to be too specific; "City, Country" is sufficient here

  event_start      (optional)
                   the starting date of the event in the format: YYYY-MM-DD

  event_end        (optional)
                   the end date of the event in the format: YYYY-MM-DD

  event_url        (optional)
                   URL to an external homepage for the event

  event_short_url  (optional)
                   in case the above URL is very long and cryptic, you can give a short and readable
                   URL here only to be displayed;
                   this must not be an actual link

  wayback_url      (optional)
                   put here the URL to the snapshot of the event's URL as it is saved by the
                   WaybackMachine of Archive.org: https://archive.org/web/

  kind             (required)
                   the kind of event this is;
                   valid values are defined in _data/event_kinds.yml

  institute        (optional)
                   institute ID (see _data/institutes.yml) organizing and hosting the event
