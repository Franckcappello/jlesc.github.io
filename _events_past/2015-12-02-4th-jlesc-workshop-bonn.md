The workshop will take place at Bonn, will gather top researchers in HPC from INRIA, the University
of Illinois, Argonne National Laboratory, Barcelona Supercomuting Center, Julisch Supercomputing
Center and Riken AICS to explore research problems related to post Petascale / Exascale
Supercomputers and present early results of their joint work.

The workshop will feature technical sessions on five main topics: Application and Numerical
libraries; Parallel Programming, runtime and tools; Resilience; Big Data, I/O and visualization;
Cloud for HPC.

The workshop will present an exceptional program with papers accepted or submitted to top level
conferences.

A key objective of the workshop is to identify new research collaborations and establish a roadmap
for their implementation.

The workshop is open to Illinois, INRIA, ANL, BSC, JSC and Riken AICS faculties, researchers,
engineers and students who want to learn more about Post Petascale / Exascale Computing.
