## Research topic and goals
Monitoring the Arctic Climate (MAC) aims at refining estimates of the sea ice state over the last the recent past. More specifically, MAC will harvest the latest high-resolution and high-quality satellite products available to generate a sea ice reanalysis at a resolution never explored up to now. This new product will not only be the longest sea ice reanalysis ever constructed, but will also count the largest number of ensemble members, which will allow for a robust estimate of the related uncertainty.

The benefits and expected knowledge expected to be derived from this new dataset are numerous. First, this new reanalysis dataset will provide for the most robust estimate of the Arctic sea ice changes over the last decades, thus delivering crucial information about changes occurring in the Arctic. MAC will also examine the impacts of this sea ice reanalysis on numerical weather prediction (NWP) and will assess to what extent NWP can benefit from using high-quality sea ice data for atmospheric analyses and forecasts, particularly for high-impact weather events with large human and economic consequences such as polar storms. This new sea ice reanalysis will also provide the most trustworthy sea ice initial conditions to initialize climate prediction systems and will be used to study the impact of sea ice losses on mid-latitude climate.

### Contributions:
- to harvest the benefits of the highest quality highest resolution sea ice satellite products, through the use of the highest resolution explored up to date in sea ice reanalysis.
- to lead to a breakthrough in the monitoring and prediction of changes in the Arctic region, the most vulnerable to climate change.
- to trigger a collaboration on data assimilation between sea ice and atmosphere
