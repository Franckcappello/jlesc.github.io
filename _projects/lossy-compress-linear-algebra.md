## Research topic and goals

Prior work has shown the effectiveness of using a multigrid hierarchy to
compress the iterative solution to reduce checkpoint size. Recently specially
designed floating-point lossy compression algorithms have gained increased
popularity due to their ability to significantly reduce floating-point data
size and bound the error at each data point. The focus of this collaboration is to explore how to use
compression techniques to improve checkpoint-based recovery routines for
multigrid methods used either as a stand alone linear system solver or as a
preconditioner for other methods such as GMRES or CG. In particular, we explore
hybrid compression techniques that switch between the lossy compressor SZ
developed at ANL and multi-level multigrid compression in order to minimize the
resilience overhead. When using SZ we explore various methods of setting the
compressorâ€™s error bounds such as a static tolerance and one that varies the
tolerance based on the current accuracy of the solver. To improve the quality
of the compressed checkpoint we create and solve a local problem based on the
patch of the solution that we are recovering. Finally, we plan to create performance
models to explore theoretical possibilities for new compressor designs and
system architectures.

The project involves JLESC Fellow Jon Calhoun, JSC affiliated graduate student
Micro Altenbernd, JSC Robert Speck, and Franck Cappello from Argonne. This
project was formed though collaborative discussions at the 2018 JLESC workshop
in Barcelona.
