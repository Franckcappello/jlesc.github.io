## Research topic and goals

We believe international surveys are suitable for the vision of
JLESC. International survey would be another type of collaboration in
JLESC to obtain the insights into Exascale computing.

The International MPI survey has been being conducted as the first survey
in this project. As part of a wide effort to understand the current
usage of the Message Passing Interface (MPI) in the development of
parallel applications and drive future additions to the MPI standard,
the objective of this project is to get feedback from the largest MPI
audience (past, current and potential users) to get a better
understanding of their needs, and the impact of different MPI
capabilities on the process of developing distributed
applications. Since this questionnaire survey will be distributed
worldwide, it is also expected to reveal country/region differences on
the above aspects.

## Results for 2018/2019

As of 02.2019 the design of the questionnaire survey is almost
done. It has been being distributed and collected since
January 2019. Due to the relatively large disparities among the
numbers of answers from countries, the questionnaire survey is not yet
closed.

## Visits and meetings

A number of online meetings, one to two meeting in a month, have been
held for the MPI International survey.
