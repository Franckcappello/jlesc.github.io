Copy this file to `_posts/` and name it according to the naming convention of news posts as

Then fill in the YAML front matter variables:

  title            The title of the news post.
                   Try to keep it short but descriptive.
  date             The date the news post was written and published.
                   Stick to the date format: YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS +ZZZZ
  updated          In case the news post has received a significant update, put in the date of the
                   last update.
                   Stick to the date format: YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS +ZZZZ
  author           The person ID of the author of the news post as defined in `_data/people.yml`
