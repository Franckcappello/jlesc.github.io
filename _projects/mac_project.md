================================
=== HOW TO USE THIS TEMPLATE ===
================================

Copy this file to `_projects` and rename it to a very short version of your project's title, e.g.
the project "Scalability Enhancements to FMM for Molecular Dynamics Simulations" chooses
"fmm_project.md".

Also copy the file `_templates/project.bib` to `_bibliography/external` and name it exactly as this
one, but the file extension, e.g. "fmm_project.bib".

For citing references, use the Liquid citing syntax as explained in the wiki:
https://github.com/JLESC/jlesc.github.io/wiki/Markup-Language#cite-and-list-publications

!IMPORTANT!
Remember to adjust the file name of the BibTeX file at the very bottom of this file!!

Then fill in the YAML header variables above.

  title            (required)
                   the full title of the project

  date             (required)
                   the date this page was created in the format: YYYY-MM-DD; this will get displayed
                   at the very bottom of the generated website

  updated          (optional)
                   in case you or somebody else came back later and edited significant parts of the
                   page, put in the date (format: YYYY-MM-DD) of that change;
                   if present, this will get displayed at the very bottom of the generated website

  project_url      (optional)
                   optional URL to some external website of the project.

  status           (optional)
                   the current status of the project;
                   you have to use one of the keys defined in '_data/project_states.yml'

  topics           (required)
                   a YAML list of topic keys (as defined in '_data/topics.yml') for this project;
                   each topic on a new line with a leading dash

  keywords         (optional)
                   a YAML list of keywords for this project;
                   each topic on a new line with a leading dash.

  head             (required)
                   the dedicated project leader;
                   this is the identifier of a person as found in '_data/people.yml'

  members          (optional)
                   a YAML list of members of this project excluding the head;
                   each member must be listed as its identifier as found in '_data/people.yml'

Now, fill in the details for the current report below. Please do not change headings, headings level
or order.

## Research topic and goals
Monitoring the Arctic Climate (MAC) aims at refining estimates of the sea ice state over the last three decades and its impact on the atmosphere as a general purpose. Its specific purpose is to harvest the benefits of the latest high-resolution and high-quality satellite products available to generate a sea ice reanalysis at a resolution never explored up-to-date and examine the impacts of this sea ice reanalysis on numerical weather prediction (NWP) using a global atmospheric data assimilation system in RIKEN AICS.

MAC will generate the longest sea ice reanalysis and counting the largest number of ensemble members available up to date, at a ground-breaking resolution and exploiting the latest high quality and high resolution satellite products available. MAC will allow for the most robust estimate of the Arctic sea ice changes over the last decades and its uncertainty performed up to date and therefore deliver crucial information about Arctic changes monitoring, being hence a project of scientific excellence. MAC will also provide the most trustworthy sea ice initial conditions to train dynamical climate prediction systems and estimate future Arctic changes. The final results will be of utmost interest for local ecosystems and populations as well as for industries willing to invest in this region. Finally, MAC will assess to what extent NWP can benefit from using the high quality sea ice data for atmospheric analyses and forecasts, particularly for high-impact weather events with drastic human and economic consequences such as polar storms and even in mid latitudes. Therefore these results will be of key social significance.

### Contributions:
- to harvest the benefits of the highest quality highest resolution sea ice satellite products, through the use of the highest resolution explored up to date in sea ice reanalysis.
- to lead to a breakthrough in the monitoring and prediction of changes in the Arctic region, the most vulnerable to climate change.
- to trigger a collaboration on data assimilation between sea ice and atmosphere
