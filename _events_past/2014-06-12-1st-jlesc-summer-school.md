The Joint Laboratory for Petascale Computing focuses on software challenges found in complex 
high-performance computers. The Joint Laboratory is based at the University of Illinois at 
Urbana-Champaign and includes researchers from the French national computer science institute Inria, 
Argonne National Laboratory, Illinois' Center for Extreme-Scale Computation, and the National Center
for Supercomputing Applications. The Barcelona Supercomputer Center also recently joined this effort. 

The 11th workshop of the INRIA-Illinois-ANL Joint Laboratory will be held at Sophia Antipolis, 
on the French riviera, from June 9th to June 11th 2014.

The first summer school of the Joint-Laboratory will follow at the same location on June 12th-13th. 
Both events are supported by the PUF in the context of the NEXTGN project. 
The theme of this summer school will be on performance metrics, modeling and simulation of large HPC systems. 
This summer school is offered to students (mainly PhD students and post-docs although Master students may also be interested) 
of the collaboration and open to students and faculties outside of the collaboration, if room. 
We are considering a maximum of 30 students.
