The 11th workshop of the INRIA-Illinois-ANL Joint Laboratory on Petascale Computing was
also the first workshop of the NEXTGN Partnership University Fund project.

It gathered top researchers in HPC from INRIA, the University of Illinois, 
the Argonne National Laboratory and Barcelona Supercomuting Center to explore research problems 
related to post Petascale Supercomputers and present early results of their joint work.

The workshop presented an exceptional program with papers accepted or submitted to top level conferences.

The workshop exposed the results of the collaboration on Parallel Programming, Resilience,I/O and Cloud.

Exascale issues, research and activities were discussed as well.

A key objective of the workshop was to identify new research collaborations and to establish a roadmap
for their implementation.

The workshop was open to Illinois, INRIA and ANL, faculties, researchers, engineers and students
who wanted to learn more about Post Petascale Computing.


## Workshop program

The workshop featured technical sessions on five main topics:

* Big systems
* Parralel Programming (Hybrid, Hierarchical, Heterogeneous)
* Resilience
* Numerical Algorithms and Libraries
* I/O, Big data
* Cloud for HPC


## Workshop venue

The workshop tooke place in the Inria Sophia Antipolis Méditerranée research centre.
The lodging for the workshop was at Hotel Mercure and Hotel Ibis.
