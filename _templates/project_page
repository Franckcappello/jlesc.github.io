=== HOW TO USE THIS TEMPLATE ===
================================

Copy this file to `_projects` and rename it to a very short version of your project's title, e.g.
the project "Scalability Enhancements to FMM for Molecular Dynamics Simulations" chooses
"fmm_project.md".

Also copy the file `_templates/project.bib` to `_bibliography/external` and name it exactly as this
one, but the file extension, e.g. "fmm_project.bib".

!IMPORTANT!
Remember to adjust the file name of the BibTeX file at the very bottom of this file!!

Then fill in the YAML header variables above.

  title            (required)
                   the full title of the project

  subtitle         (optional)
                   for projectss with 'page_type=project_page' (see below) this is optional, for
                   projects' subpages ('page_type=project_subpage') (see below) this is required

  date             (required)
                   the date this page was created in the format: YYYY-MM-DD; this will get displayed

                   the current status of the project;

  topics           (optional)
                   a YAML list of topic keys (as defined in '_data/topics.yml') for this project;
                   each topic on a new line with a leading dash

  keywords         (optional)
                   a YAML list of keywords for this project;
                   each topic on a new line with a leading dash.

                   each member must be listed as its identifier as found in '_data/people.yml'

  page_type        (required)
                   for the main page of a project (the default), this has field has to have the value
                   `project_page`; for subpages of a project this has to have the value
                   `project_subpage`

======================================
== Creating Sub Pages for a Project ==
======================================
Each project can have multiple sub-pages.
These sub-pages are accessible via the tabbed sub-navigation just below the project's title on the
project's page.

To create a sub-page, do the following:

1. Create a folder in `_projects` with the exact same name as the Markdown file of the project
   (without the file extension).

2. Copy this template into the folder and give it a descriptive name and Markdown file extension
   (`.md`).

3. Copy all the YAML front matter from the project's main page to the sub-page.

3. Adjust YAML front matter fields for the sub-page:
   - `page_type` must be 'project_subpage'
   - `subtitle` must be given

Example
-------
Given an event Markdown file `_projects/world-domination.md`.
To create a sub-page for the World Domination project, we create a folder
`_projects/world-domination`, copy this template into that folder and rename it to `schedule.md`.
Then, in `_projects/world-domination/schedule.md`, we copy the YAML front matter from
`_projects/world-domination.md` to replace the YAML front matter of `schedule.md` and change the
YAML fields `page_type` to 'project_subpage' and `subtitle` to 'Schedule'.

Now, we have get a second tab on the 'World Domination' project page with the title 'Schedule'.
